# Sing App Vue Dashboard - free and open source admin dashboard template

The comprehensive package also includes full versions of Bootstrap 4, React with backend integration, Vue.js,Angular, and Angular JS, covering many development needs in the business software landscape.

## Features

Using this template you will be able to leverage lots of built-in components and thus focus on building features that set you apart from competitors rather than bulding everything from scratch. Lite version of a Sing-app includes following features and pages:

* Styled Bootstrap components like buttons, modals, etc
* Dashboard sample
* Typography
* Tables
* Notifications

## Quick Start

#### 1. Get the latest version

You can start by cloning the latest version of Sing App Vue Dashboard on your local machine by running:

```shell
$ git clone

$ cd MyApp
```

#### 2. Run `yarn install`

This will install both run-time project dependencies and developer tools listed
in [package.json](../package.json) file. We are moving all dependencies to npm, so there will be no bower dependencies soon.

#### 3. Run `yarn build`

This command will build the app from the source files (`/src`) into the output
`/dist` folder. Then open `dist/index.html` in your browser.

Now you can open your web app in a browser, on mobile devices and start
hacking. The page must be served from a web server, e.g. apache, nginx, WebStorm built-in web server, etc., otherwise some features may not work properly.

#### 3. Run `yarn serve`
This command will watch for changes in `/src` and recompile vue templates & scss styles on the fly.
